    "1. How would you get more information about the `ord()` built-in function?\n",
    "2. How would you get more information about the `center()` method that belongs to the `str` class\n",
    "3. Create a string literal for the value after the colon and assign it to the variable `test`: Let's go run now!\n",
    "4. Create a multiline string literal for one of the verses of [Row, Row, Row Your Boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row,_Row,_Row_Your_Boat)\n",
    "5. For these questions, create a variable called `excited` that has the following string repeated 10 times: \"I'm so excited!\\n\".  For this, we can use string  duplication: `excited = \"I'm so excited!\\n\" * 10`\n",
    "   1. How long is the string in the variable `excited`? Use a function to get the answer\n",
    "   2. Using code, what is the first letter of `excited`?  The last letter? \n",
    "   3. Get a string (a substring) from `excited` with the last 9 characters.\n",
    "   4. Get a substring from `excited` starting at the first position(0), but skip every 17th character. What is unusual about this result?\n",
    "6. Split the following string by dashes:<br>```a = \"20220502-https://python.org-200-127.0.0.1\"```\n",
    "7. You have just arrived at a dystopian society that does not believe in vowels.  Write a function to remove any vowels from a string and return a result.  For some reason, they don't mind y's.\n",
    "8. Given the following string, extract the portion after the colon and convert it to an integer variable.\n",
    "```\n",
    "line = 'Conference Attendance:14000'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use `find()` and string slicing to extract the string.<br>\n",
    "9. Repeat the previous question, but use `split()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like more practice, look at some of the functions not covered in the exercises.  Try comparing different strings."
